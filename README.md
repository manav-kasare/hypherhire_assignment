Both the client and server sides are coded in typescript to maintain type definitions, data structure and have less code bugs.
I have used my own way to coding the client side apps and have used my own template. Let me know if you faace any problems running the app!

## Instructions for server
1. The mock data resides in src/mocks. You can change the "cover" in book mock data and add book cover links. The client app will show the images 

## Instructions for client app
1. You can change the API_URL in src/services/config.ts to your local IP or wherever you decide to host the server
